THREADER
--------

An utility for launching other applications in more processes. For example, run you can run a lame converter in 4 threads to convert all files in the specific directory so that you can minimize the time neccessary for conversion. 

This is a working code, however the Makefile is not yet complete and the instructions on how to compile and use this program  will be written here.
